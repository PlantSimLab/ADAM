## dvd_stochasitic_runner.pl
## Multi-function, stochastic DVD Processing
## This script takes a number of nodes, the number of states, and the filename for the input file
## Functions can be read from the input file with the possiblity for more than one function per node
## Authored by Jonte Craighead and Franziska Hinkelmann
#
# Use: perl dvd_stochasitic_runner.pl #nodes #states all_trajectories_flag
# update_stochastic_flag outputfilename graph_format dependencygraph_flag
# update_sequential_flag update_schedule inputfile.txt
# 
# If this script is run, Stochastic is hard coded to 1, so we always get a
# probabilities in the graph (maybe this should be changed?)
#
# The all_trajectories_flag set means all possible arrows are drawn in one
# graph, without this option, one update is choosen at random for every
# variables - the program should always be run with the flag turned on, since
# this produces the phase space, the other option produces one possible
# trajectory for each state but not a simulation starting from one state
# 
# update_stochastic_flag set means that we treat the system as an update
# stochastic systems (the udpate schedule is random). This is simulated by
# using a function stochastic system where each function set has two members:
# the local update function and the identity. The probabilities are set such
# that (nodes-1) functions are delayed and only one function is updated. If
# the user gives a family of update functions for one node, an error is
# returned, because a function and update stochastic system is not
# allowed. 

# Need this so I can have access from a different folder - needs to be changed
# for polymath
