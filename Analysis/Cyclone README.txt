*** CYCLONE ***			Paul Vines 6-27-2011
Cyclone finds all limit cycles in a PDS produced from
a specified input file, for a PDS of 3 states (0, 1, 2).

*** TO RUN ***
1) Execute Cyclone.exe <number of states> <filepath>

2) Enter the name/path to the input file
   This file should be formatted just like an input to ADAM

3) The program will output all limit cycles to a file
   named the same as the input file but ending with "_results"

NOTES:
Both command-line arguments must be entered to have an effect
otherwise the prompts are displayed
