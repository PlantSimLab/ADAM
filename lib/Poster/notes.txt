Poster Structure:

Intro:
	-Some intro sentences about the motivation
	-pictoral diagram of Model overview/Analysis
	-some sentences descrbing diagram
	-info about PDS including eqn. example (..maybe truth table?)

Definitions:
	-lambda phage example (biologial example)
		gene expression, four genes, vector with four entries
	-example state space w/ highlighted dynamics 
		(example dependency graph?)
	-limit cycle, fixed point, component

Results:
	-before/after
	-snapshot of website   (with example..this many states, time)
		-no download. free web-based
	-explanations of various options
---waiting for website redesign
	-show output from 4-node lambda phage example 

Methods:
	-algorithms coded in Macaulay2 w/ Sugarless option to GB comps
	-discrete systems to PDS
	-sparse systems 
	-GB triangular strutuce => back substitution / elimination theory
	-speed of GB computations (benchmarks-chart? & GINsim tests)
			---trying to make histogram of GINsim tests (fixed pts.)
	-mention Conjunctive/Disjunctive networks

Conclusion:
	-probs just conclusion paragraph	
	

NEED to update and number references and add citations where they're needed.
