Network Description
n = 5 p = 3

Input Functions
f1 = x5
f2 = x4+x6
f3 = x3
f4 = x2
f5 = x1

Network Options
Large, 2 cycles

Does not display error message for large network
Gives correct error message for small network
--DONE--

Limitations lists restricted number of states that can be displayed in a state space to be 1000, but cannot display the state space of a model with 512 states (yeastOrlando).
--I've run into this error also before. I think the program just doesn't make the image or something for some reason. Anyway, I don't really want to fix it...--

This network does not work for as a large network: 
f1 = x1
f2 = x2
f3 = x3
