Models can be hierarchically structured, allowing for the mastering of larger networks. To move easily between the qualitative, stochastic and continuous modelling paradigms, models can be converted into each other. We get models sharing structure, but specialized by their kinetic information. The analysis and iterative reverse engineering of biomolecular networks is supported by the simultaneous use of several Petri net classes, while the graphical user interface adapts dynamically to the active one. Built-in animation and simulation are complemented by exports to various analysis tools. Snoopy facilitates the addition of new Petri net classes thanks to its generic design.Availability: Our tool with Petri net samples is available free of charge for non-commercial use at http://www-dssz.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/snoopy.html; supported operating systems: Mac OS X, Windows and Linux (selected distributions).Contact: snoopy@informatik.tu-cottbus.de},

The dynamics of gene expression, for example, can be modeled with Boolean networks (BNs). These are mathematical models of low complexity, but have the advantage of being able to capture essential properties of gene-regulatory networks. However, current implementations of BNs only focus on different sub-aspects of this model and do not allow for a seamless integration into existing preprocessing pipelines.Results: BoolNet efficiently integrates methods for synchronous, asynchronous and probabilistic BNs. This includes reconstructing networks from time series, generating random networks, robustness analysis via perturbation, Markov chain simulations, and identification and visualization of attractors.Availability: The package BoolNet is freely available from the R project at http://cran.r-project.org/ or http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/mitarbeiter/HKestler/boolnet/ under Artistic License 2.0.Contact: hans.kestler@uni-ulm.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Signal transduction pathways are usually modelled using classical quantitative methods, which are based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, some difficulties are inherent in this approach. On the one hand, the kinetic parameters involved are often unknown and have to be estimated. With increasing size and complexity of signal transduction pathways, the estimation of missing kinetic data is not possible. On the other hand, ODEs based models do not support any explicit insights into possible (signal-) flows within the network. Moreover, a huge amount of qualitative data is available due to high-throughput techniques. In order to get information on the systems behaviour, qualitative analysis techniques have been developed. Applications of the known qualitative analysis methods concern mainly metabolic networks. Petri net theory provides a variety of established analysis techniques, which are also applicable to signal transduction models. In this context special properties have to be considered and new dedicated techniques have to be designed.METHODS:We apply Petri net theory to model and analyse signal transduction pathways first qualitatively before continuing with quantitative analyses. This paper demonstrates how to build systematically a discrete model, which reflects provably the qualitative biological behaviour without any knowledge of kinetic parameters. The mating pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as case study.RESULTS:We propose an approach for model validation of signal transduction pathways based on the network structure only. For this purpose, we introduce the new notion of feasible t-invariants, which represent minimal self-contained subnets being active under a given input situation. Each of these subnets stands for a signal flow in the system. We define maximal common transition sets (MCT-sets), which can be used for t-invariant examination and net decomposition into smallest biologically meaningful functional units.CONCLUSION:The paper demonstrates how Petri net analysis techniques can promote a deeper understanding of signal transduction pathways. The new concepts of feasible t-invariants and MCT-sets have been proven to be useful for model validation and the interpretation of the biological system behaviour. Whereas MCT-sets provide a decomposition of the net into disjunctive subnets, feasible t-invariants describe subnets, which generally overlap. This work contributes to qualitative modelling and to the analysis of large biological networks by their fully automatic decomposition into biologically meaningful modules.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: An increasing number of discrete mathematical models are being published in Systems Biology, ranging from Boolean network models to logical models and Petri nets. They are used to model a variety of biochemical networks, such as metabolic networks, gene regulatory networks and signal transduction networks. There is increasing evidence that such models can capture key dynamic features of biological networks and can be used successfully for hypothesis generation.  Results: This article provides a unified framework that can aid the mathematical analysis of Boolean network models, logical models and Petri nets. They can be represented as polynomial dynamical systems, which allows the use of a variety of mathematical tools from computer algebra for their analysis. Algorithms are presented for the translation into polynomial dynamical systems. Examples are given of how polynomial algebra can be used for the model analysis.

@article{Klamt,
	Abstract = {Background Structural analysis of cellular interaction
      networks contributes to a deeper understanding of network-wide
        interdependencies, causal relationships, and basic functional
        capabilities. While the structural analysis of metabolic networks is a
        well-established field, similar methodologies have been scarcely developed
        and applied to signaling and regulatory networks. Results We propose
        formalisms and methods, relying on adapted and partially newly introduced
        approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and
        regulatory networks with focus on functional aspects. We use two different
        formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction
        graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction
        graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling
        paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation of
        elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the set of
        signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation of
        intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into
        activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors with
        respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects induced
        by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the network scheme.
        Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture AND relationships
        which do frequently occur in interaction networks. The consequent logical
        concatenation of all the arcs pointing into a species leads to Boolean
        networks. For a Boolean representation of cellular interaction networks we
        propose a formalism based on logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs,
      which facilitates in particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA).
        LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the
        identification of optimal intervention points (targets) in cellular
        networks. LSSA also reveals network regions whose parametrization and
        initial states are crucial for the dynamic behavior. We have implemented
        these methods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of
            FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate their applicability using a logical model of
        T-Cell receptor signaling providing non-intuitive results regarding
        feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon
        different stimuli. Conclusion The methods and formalisms we propose herein
        are another step towards the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular
        interaction networks. Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell
        signaling model, makes them a promising tool.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Our goal is to construct a model for genetic regulatory networks such that the model class: (i) incorporates rule-based dependencies between genes; (ii) allows the systematic study of global network dynamics; (iii) is able to cope with uncertainty, both in the data and the model selection; and (iv) permits the quantification of the relative influence and sensitivity   of genes in their interactions with other genes.  Results: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that   share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks--a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.
