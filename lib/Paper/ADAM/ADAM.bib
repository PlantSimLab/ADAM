	Abstract = {Motivation: An increasing number of discrete mathematical models are being published in Systems Biology, ranging from Boolean network models to logical models and Petri nets. They are used to model a variety of biochemical networks, such as metabolic networks, gene regulatory networks and signal transduction networks. There is increasing evidence that such models can capture key dynamic features of biological networks and can be used successfully for hypothesis generation.  Results: This article provides a unified framework that can aid the mathematical analysis of Boolean network models, logical models and Petri nets. They can be represented as polynomial dynamical systems, which allows the use of a variety of mathematical tools from computer algebra for their analysis. Algorithms are presented for the translation into polynomial dynamical systems. Examples are given of how polynomial algebra can be used for the model analysis.

	Abstract = {Background Structural analysis of cellular interaction
      networks contributes to a deeper understanding of network-wide
        interdependencies, causal relationships, and basic functional
        capabilities. While the structural analysis of metabolic networks is a
        well-established field, similar methodologies have been scarcely developed
        and applied to signaling and regulatory networks. Results We propose
        formalisms and methods, relying on adapted and partially newly introduced
        approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and
        regulatory networks with focus on functional aspects. We use two different
        formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction
        graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction
        graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling
        paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation of
        elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the set of
        signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation of
        intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into
        activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors with
        respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects induced
        by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the network scheme.
        Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture AND relationships
        which do frequently occur in interaction networks. The consequent logical
        concatenation of all the arcs pointing into a species leads to Boolean
        networks. For a Boolean representation of cellular interaction networks we
        propose a formalism based on logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs,
      which facilitates in particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA).
        LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the
        identification of optimal intervention points (targets) in cellular
        networks. LSSA also reveals network regions whose parametrization and
        initial states are crucial for the dynamic behavior. We have implemented
        these methods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of
            FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate their applicability using a logical model of
        T-Cell receptor signaling providing non-intuitive results regarding
        feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon
        different stimuli. Conclusion The methods and formalisms we propose herein
        are another step towards the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular
        interaction networks. Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell
        signaling model, makes them a promising tool.},

@article{shmulevich,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Our goal is to construct a model for genetic regulatory networks such that the model class: (i) incorporates rule-based dependencies between genes; (ii) allows the systematic study of global network dynamics; (iii) is able to cope with uncertainty, both in the data and the model selection; and (iv) permits the quantification of the relative influence and sensitivity   of genes in their interactions with other genes.  Results: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that   share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks--a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.
