	To demonstrate our software and its efficiency, 25 GINsim files were converted into polynomial dynamical systems. Fixed points and limit cycles of varying lengths were then calculated, and the time to do this was recorded. A spreadsheet of this data was made to store all of this information. The first column contains the name of the GINsim file. The second column lists the number of nodes (genes/proteins) in the model. The third column lists the number of possible states each node can have. In subsequent columns, the number of cycles, a list of the cycles of that length, and the time it took to compute those cycles (in seconds) are each listed in a column. This is done for fixed points up to 20 cycles. At the end of the spreadsheet is a column for the URL of the location of each GINsim file.
