In benchmarkGBboolean:
    tests 50
    between 10-20 variables, max variables per term range 2-6
    all under .5 minutes
    
In benchmarkHighValence:
   tests 46  (I feel like there were 50 of these and I miscounted..)
   between 10-20 variable, max variables per term 10-15, num terms 5-9
   using Sugarless
   6 under 1 min, most under .05(I'm going with 44) ,one which took 6.1615 miuntes
   
   tests 8
   20-30 vars, max vars per term 10-15, num terms 5-9
   using Sugerless
   all under .5 minutes

In benchmarkManyTerms:
   I just wrote there were a lot of terms, like on the order on 100-1,000,000
   vars b/t 10-20, max vars per term 2-6
   38 less than .5 minutes
   5 under 6 minutes
   1 took 10 minutes
   1 took 23
   1 took 30
   1 took 63
   (same here cause this doesn't add to 50. ugh.)

In benchmarkMonomialNetwork:
   vars 10-20, num terms = 1, max vars per term 2-6
   50  less than .05
   10 vars 20-30, same as before
   5 vars 30-40, same
   5 vars 40-50, all less that .5
   Sugerless

In benchmarkMonomial:
   -basically the same as the previous... may look at later

In benchmarkMoreThan50:
   Sugarless
   there are 50+ (50-100 maybe)vars, num terms b/t 1-5, max num vars per term 2-6
   3 under 1 minute
-the in died

In benchmark:
   -various benchmark test under diff conditions to test diff GB options

In benchmarkValence5:
   only 1 test before crash
   80 vars, monomials, 5 vars per term, .14 minutes
   Sugerless

In benchmarkValence5:
   Sugarless
   2 vars per term, num terms 6-10, vars 50-100
   all 50 under .05
  
In benchmarkValence5Vars40:
   Sugarless
   num vars 40-50, num terms 1-8, max num vars per term = 5
   7 under .5 min
   1 under 1 min
   1 took 10 minutes
   1 took 132 minutes
   1 took 1962 minutes

In benchmarkValence6Vars40:
   Sugarless
   only 1 test ran, 48 vars, 9 terms, max num vars = 6
   didn't even compute basis and time
