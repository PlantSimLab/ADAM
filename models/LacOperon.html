<h3>Description</h3>
The lac operon in Escherichia coli has been studied extensively and is
one of the earliest gene systems found to undergo both positive and negative control.The lac operon is known to exhibit bistability, in the sense that the operon is either induced or uninduced. Many dynamical models have been proposed to capture this phenomenon. While most are based on complex mathematical formulations, it has been suggested that for other gene systems network topology is sufficient to produce the desired dynamical behavior. We present a Boolean network as a discrete model for the lac operon. We include the two main glucose control mechanisms of catabolite repression and inducer exclusion in the model and show that it exhibits bistability. Further we present a reduced model which shows that lac mRNA and lactose form the core of the lac
operon, and that this reduced model also exhibits the same dynamics. This work corroborates the claim that the key to dynamical properties is the topology of the network and signs of interactions.<br>

Le and Ge are extra cellular lactose and glucose and they will be considered as parameters in the model.<br>
<h3>Number of States</h3>
2
<br>
<h3>Key Dynamic Features</h3>
There are going to be 4 cases, since a pair of parameters are involved with each parameter having 2 states. so the 4 cases are going to be when (Le,Ge) = (0,0),(0,1),(1,1) and (1,0) <br>

<h3>Analysis of State Space when (Le,Ge) = (0,0) </h3>
There are 1 components and 1 fixed point(s)<br>
TOTAL: 512 = 2^9 nodes<br>
Printing fixed point(s)...<br>
[ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ] lies in a component of size 512. <br>

<h3>Analysis of State Space when (Le,Ge) = (0,1) </h3>
There are 1 components and 1 fixed point(s)<br>
TOTAL: 512 = 2^9 nodes<br>
Printing fixed point(s)...<br>
[ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ] lies in a component of size 512.<br>

[ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ] lies in a component of size 512.<br>

"In summary, the model predicts that the lac operon is OFF when extracellular glucose is available or there is neither extracellular glucose or lactose. When extracellular lactose is available and extracellular glucose is not, the model predicts that the operon is ON.
That is, the model has two steady states."

"Just as with the model H, the reduced model has two different steady states, each corresponding to the operon being ON or OFF. Hence, reduction has preserved the dynamics of the system."
