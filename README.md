ADAM
====
 ADAM uses a combination of simulation and mathematical algorithms to analyze the dynamics of discrete biological systems. It can analyze bounded Petri-nets (generated with Snoopy), Logical Models (in GINSim format), Polynomial Dynamical Systems (PDS), open Polynomial Dynamical Systems (oPDS), Probabilistic Boolean (or multistate) Networks, Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (SDDS), and open Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (oSDDS). For small enough networks (deterministic or probabilistic), ADAM simulates the complete state space of the model and finds all attractors (steady states and limit cycles) together with statistics about the size of components. For larger networks, ADAM computes fixed points for both deterministic and probabilistic networks, and limit cycle of the length specified by the user for deterministic networks. You can follow our step-by-step tutorial or read the user guide. It is important that you follow the format specified in the guide. Make your selections and provide inputs (if any) in the form below and click Analyze to run the software. To generate a model from experimental time course data, you can use Polynome.
