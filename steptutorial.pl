				<a name="GS" id="GS">How to use a Logical Model (GINsim file) as an input</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Select <b>Logical Model</b> as the format of the input functions
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that input for number of states per node is not allowed as it is not needed. Adam pulls this information from the GINsim file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upload the 4 node Lambda Phage model named regulatoryGraph.ginml (inside the zipped folder phage4.zginml available <a href="http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/model_repository/MICROBIOLOGICAL%20REGULATORY%20NETWORKS/Phage%20Lambda/PhageLambda/description.html">here</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				Select Simulation (as the model is small enough with only four nodes)
			</p>
			<p>
				<img border="0" width="434" height="347" src="steptutorial_files/image002.png">

			<h2>
				<a name="PDS" id="PDS">How to enter a Polynomial Dynamical System</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Select <b>PDS</b> as the format for input functions
			</p>
			<p>
				Enter the number of states each node may have. For this example, enter 3. This indicates each node may be 0, 1 or 2
			</p>
			<p>
				Enter the functions in the text box below. For this example we will have 2 functions. Enter
			</p>
			<p>
				f1 = x1*x2
			</p>
			<p>
				f2 = x1+x2
			</p>
			<p>
				Under network options, select simulation, as there are only 2 nodes. Leave synchronous selected for the updating scheme to have the states updated synchronously, and leave all trajectories selected to view the entire state space.

			<h2>
				<a name="PBN" id="PBN">How to Enter a Probabilistic Boolean Network</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Select <b>PBN</b> as the format for function input.
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of states per node must now be set to 2 and the drop-box to the right must be changed from polynomial to boolean.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this example, enter the following for the functions:
			</p>
			<p>
				f1 = (x1*x2)
			</p>
			<p>
				f2 = (x1+x3)
			</p>
			<p>
				f3 = (~(x1+x2))
			</p>
			<p>
				This is read as f1 equals x1 AND x2, f2 equals x1 OR x3, f3 equals NOT (x1 OR x2). Note that each operation must have a set of parenthesis that correspond to it. It is important not to place extra sets of parenthesis in any of the equations. Note that changing f3 to (~((x1)+x2)) gives a different, incorrect output as there is an unnecessary set of parenthesis around x1.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under network options, select simulation, as there are only 3 nodes. Leave synchronous selected for the updating scheme to have the states updated synchronously, and leave all trajectories selected to view the entire state space.

			<h2>
				<a name="LN" id="LN">How to Enter a Large Network (number of nodes &gt; 11)</a>

				Select GINsim as the format of the input functions.

			<p>
				Note that input for number of states per node is not allowed as it is not needed. Adam pulls this information from the GINsim file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upload the TCR model named TCRsig40.ginml(inside the zipped folder phage4.zginml available <a href="http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/model_repository/MAMMALIAN%20REGULATORY%20NETWORKS/T%20lymphocytes/TCR_sig/description.html">here</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				Select Algorithms (as the model has 40 nodes and its state space is too large to be simulated), and enter 7 for the limit cycle length to view all 7-cycles.

				<a name="conj" id="conj">How to Enter a Conjunctive Network</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Select <b>PBN</b> the format of input functions for this example (either PDS or PBN may be used).
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of states per node must be set to two. Select Boolean as we are entering a PBN, but for a PDS select Polynomial.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the function box enter

				f1 = (x1*x3)

			<p>
				f2 = (x2*x1)
			</p>
			<p>
				f3 = (x2*x3)
			</p>
			<p>
				The functions must only use either the AND operator or the OR operator. Additionally, the dependency graph formed from these functions must be strongly connected.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img border="0" width="434" height="128" src="steptutorial_files/image022.png">
			</p>
			<p>
				Select Conjunctive network.
